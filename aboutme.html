    <p> I was born and raised in Tacloban Leyte; however, I am now currently residing in Pardo. I have two older 
        siblings, which makes me the youngest. I have two dogs and six cats. My passion revolves around dancing, reading, watching, and playing badminton.
        I am a dedicated student pursuing Bachelor of Information in Technology at CIT-U. I got into this
        field because I am invested on learning programming and any things that is related in technology. 
        My ideal career after I graduate is to become a web developer or a software engineer someday.</p>
